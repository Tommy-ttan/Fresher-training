EX1
* Ver1
    * Good point:
        - Result is good at 80%
        - Can use while (), do {} while(), for()
        - Can use struct
    * Need to improve:
        - declare variable with default value 
        - Coding convention
            - nameing variable
            - format code
            - declare part and logic part
        - default value of variable
        - need use fucntion for modulize
    * Question
        - distinguish char and string
        - why need to use float
* Ver2
    * Good point:
        - Result is good
        - Improve almost conding convention in ver 1
        - Asign value for variable before using
        - Can use function
    * Need to improve
        - Coding convention:
            - format code
            - declare variable
            - return type of function

EX2
* Ver 1
    * Good point:
        - Result is good at first timne
        - Better coding convention: format code, naming
    * Need to improve:
        - Coding convention
            - Meaningless naming
            - Declare part
        - Choose suitable variable type
        - Should use function to check condition of password
        - A function should do one job
    * Question
        - Enum
        - Switch - case
        - Boolean return type
* Ver 2
    * Good point:
        - Coding convention: meaningful naming, format code
        - Function does specific job
    * Need to improve:
        - Return type of bool function should be true - false
        - Risk point when cast type from bool to int
    * Question:
        - why bool + bool = int
        level = upperCaseAlphabet(password) + lowerCaseAlphabet(password) + digits(password) + specialCharacter(password);

EX3
* Good point:
    - Result is good at first timne
* Need to improve:
    - should #define in header file and include
* Question:
    - Maloc and Caloc

EX4
* Ver1
    * Need to improve
        - should use pointer to input array
        - write value to array pointer 
        - should free after malloc
* Ver2
    * Good point 
        - can write value to array pointer
        - free after malloc
    * Need to improve
        - declare param of inputArray() as a pointer
        - check implement of binarySearch() function
        - don't need to #define with a specific value when using as config
    * Question
        - how to debug: run step by step in binarySearch() function
        - distinguish #if and #ifdef
* Ver3
    * Good point
        - good result

EX5
* Ver 1
    * Good point
        - Result is good at first time
    * Need to improve
        - return type of function
        - index of list should be begin with 1
    * Question
        - how head move when add/delete a node in list
* Ver 2
    * Good point 
        - return type for all function
        - modify delete function to index of list start from 1

EX6
* Ver 1
    * Good point 
        - True implement
    * Need to improve
        - Confusion when choose row or col
        - Should use enum to classify user choise
        - distinguish callback_function and execute_callback_function
        - sum function should return a sum (int)
        - return type of function
* Ver 2
    * Good point
        - improve all point in previous version
