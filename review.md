* Good point:
    - Result is good at 80%
    - Can use while (), do {} while(), for()
    - Can use struct
* Need to improve:
    - declare variable with default value 
    - Coding convention
        - nameing variable
        - format code
        - declare part and logic part
    - defaul value of variable
    - need use fucntion for modulize
* Question
    - distinguish char and string
    - why need to use float
